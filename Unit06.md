**Unit 6: Statistics** <span id="6"></span> 

*Newspapers, television commentators, politicians, and sports
commentators talk about statistics all the time. This will be your
opportunity to really understand the numbers they are referencing and
make your own judgments and conclusions. Statistics have a range of ways
they can be interpreted, and you want to make sure you are active in
your own learning from these various sources. During this unit, you will
learn some differences between measures of center and how data varies.
You will also learn about how data distributed on a graph can tell
viewers a lot about what they are seeing if they look closely enough.
Many people say “numbers don’t lie,” but don’t forget, it is your job to
make sure you are getting the truth about the numbers.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 6 hours and 15
minutes.

☐ Subunit 6.1: 30 minutes

☐ Subunit 6.2: 30 minutes

☐ Subunit 6.3: 1 hour and 15 minutes

☐ Subunit 6.4: 4 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Identify a statistical question that will anticipate variability in
    the data.

-   Explain how the measures of center represent a set of data.

-   Compare and contrast the difference between measures of center and a
    measure of variation.

-   Visually summarize a set of data using box plots, dot plots, and
    histograms.

**6.1 Measures of Center** <span id="6.1"></span> 

*In the 2013 NBA Playoff, Miami Heat star player LeBron James had 25.9
PPG (points per game). Most people, whether they are basketball fans or
not, can probably tell you that it is not possible to score 0.9 of a
point in a basketball game. So where did this number come from? Sports
statistics are an example of taking a set of data and using a measure of
center to describe the data set with one number. In this subunit, you
will learn about three specific measures of center - mean, median, and
mode. These might already be familiar to you; however, you will also
learn about the importance of when to use, and not use, each of these
specific measurements. In the case of LeBron James, the mean was used to
calculate the average points he scored in all the NBA playoff games. *

    Link: YouTube: Mathispower4u: James Sousa’s [“Mean, Median, and
    Mode”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQAod4-az8) (YouTube)

    Instructions: As you watch the video, take notes of the definitions
    for mean, median, and mode. Do the example problems with the
    instructor. Take the time to write out all the data points and solve
    for each measure of center. Pay extra-close attention at about the
    6:10 point in the video when the instructor begins talking about why
    it’s important to have multiple measures of center. He introduces
    the word outlier and then goes on to show a really informative
    animation about how changing one value can have different effects on
    the data.

    Watching the video and taking notes should take you approximately 15
    minutes.

**6.2 Statistical Questioning** <span id="6.2"></span> 

*A statistical question is one that accounts for variability. For
example, if you were asked, “How old are you?” there is only one
answer - no variability. However, if you were asked, “How old are all
the kids in your neighborhood?” then one could anticipate variability in
ages. Therefore, “How old are all the kids in your neighborhood?” is a
statistical question.*

*Consider the question: “Who was the first president of the United
States?” This is not a statistical question because there is only one
answer. There is no variability in the answer.*

*Consider the question: “How tall are the roller coasters at Cedar Point
Amusement Park?” This question would result in a variety of answer
because there are multiple roller coasters that have variability in
their heights. This means this is a statistical question.*

**6.3 Statistical Variability** <span id="6.3"></span> 

*Numbers are everywhere. We often look at surveys or statistics and make
conclusions about situations. Perhaps you have looked at temperatures
for an upcoming vacation destination to know what kind of clothes to
pack in your suitcase. If the temperatures have a wide range of
variability, then you might end up packing lots of clothes so you are
prepared for the different temperatures! As you work through this
subunit you will learn a few different ways to measure variability.*

    Instructions: The purpose of this resource is to learn about how
    find a quartile within a set of data. You will only be using part of
    this resource to gather information. Read the “Guidance” section,
    and take notes on how to find the median, lower quartile, and upper
    quartile. You will use these words in the next resource, and again
    in subunit 6.4 when you make a box plot. Add the words from the
    “Vocabulary” section to your notes.

    Reading this lesson and taking notes should take you approximately
    15 minutes.

    Instructions: Read the introduction to learn about measures of
    dispersion. Although it is a review, read about range and take any
    additional notes you might find helpful.

    Take notes as you read about the interquartile range (IQR). Remember
    that to find the different quartiles, you must use the median of the
    entire data; then the median of the first half of the data = lower
    quartile = Q1; and finally the median of the second half of the data
    = upper quartile = Q3.

    Read about why the IQR is important and when is it used. Complete
    the exercises in the “Review Questions” section.

    Reading this lesson, taking notes, and completing the example
    problems should take you approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Scroll about halfway down the page until you see the
    section titled “Mean Absolute Deviation.” Read through the text and
    the first example that results in a mean absolute deviation of 3.75.
    Read through the same section one more time, taking notes and
    solving the problem step-by-step. Look at the next example with the
    two teams. Try solving for the mean and then the mean absolute
    deviation on your own. Scroll down to check your work or to get a
    hint for the next steps in solving the problem. Take notes on the
    final paragraph that explains what the mean absolute deviation
    represents for a data set. At the end of this paragraph, follow the
    second link, which leads to a video that shows another example of
    finding the mean absolute deviation. As you watch the video, pause
    it when the instructor gives you the data points, solve for the mean
    absolute deviation, and then watch the remainder of the video to
    check your work. Note: The section prior to the information on mean
    absolute deviation is “Measures of Central Tendency,” and the
    section following the information on mean absolute deviation is
    “Interquartile Range.” If you want additional information about
    either of these two concepts, review them at this time. Taking
    notes, completing the examples, and watching the video should take
    you approximately 45 minutes.

    Instructions: This video shows that a measure of variability can be
    broken down into one single number, much like a measure of center
    can. As you watch the video, take notes about not only how to find
    range and mean absolute deviation, but also what their values mean
    in terms of the variability of the data set.

    Write a paragraph that compares and contrasts mean to mean absolute
    deviation. Give more than just the definition of each - explain how
    to solve for each, when they are used, what each number tells you in
    general about the set of data. Spend some time looking at your own
    world for a situation where you might use each of these statistical
    measurements.

    Watching the video and taking notes should take you approximately 15

**6.4 Summarizing Data Sets** <span id="6.4"></span> 

*Have you ever been given a bunch of data and asked to summarize what it
all means? Perhaps you saw in the local newspaper the daily temperatures
from the last month. Trying to make sense of 30 temperatures can get
confusing if you don’t have a way to display the data. In this subunit
you will learn about three ways to display data - dot plots, histograms,
and box plots. You will also learn about how to describe the shape of
the graph and what the shape tells you about the data set in general.
You probably have some experience with other types of graphs. As you
work this subunit, use your prior knowledge to compare and contrast the
other types of graphs you already know about to the ones you will make
here. *

    Instructions: As you watch the video, pause it to do a quick sketch
    and label of each graph example. This allows you to have a visual in
    your notebook of each of the graphs mentioned in the video. It is
    important that you feel confident with how to explain a graph’s
    overall shape in mathematical terms.

    Watching the video and taking notes should take you approximately 15
    minutes.

    Instructions: Read about the boys on the track team and their
    heights. Read the “Guidance” section and take notes about the word
    frequency and note how to make a frequency table. Continue reading
    about histograms. You are probably familiar with a bar graph. Notice
    that with a histogram there can be an interval of numbers on the
    horizontal axis, and there is also no space in between the bars of
    data.

    Go through each of the true/false example questions and check your
    solutions. Use the frequency table already made for you to make a
    histogram to represent the heights of the boys from each team.
    Notice how you can use wider intervals and have two bars of
    different colors to separate the schools. This is called a double
    histogram.

    In your notebook, copy the words from the “Vocabulary” section.
    Complete the “Guided Practice” problem in your notebook and check
    your solution. Skip the video. Complete questions 1 - 3 from the
    “Practice” section.

    Reading this lesson, taking notes, and completing the practice
    problems should take you approximately 45 minutes.

    instructor introduces the word quartile. Note that there are four
    quartiles (think four quarters). You will use quartiles to set up
    the box plot. As you work, notice you are using the median
    throughout the data. Continue following along with the instructor to
    make the box plot.

    Watching this video and taking notes should take you approximately
    15 minutes.

     Instructions: Question a asks you to summarize the information
    using an appropriate graph. You should summarize the data using a
    dot plot, histogram, and box plot. Although it is not usually
    necessary to make three graphs of the same data, this is a good
    opportunity to show your ability to make these graphs.  
     When you answer question b, you need to make sure you answer the
    question in complete detail. The question asks you to describe the
    shape (skewed), center (mean and median), and variability
    (interquartile range and mean absolute deviation).  
     Check your solutions for a - c on pages two and three.  
     Making the graphs, describing the data, and checking your solutions
    should take you approximately 30 minutes.
